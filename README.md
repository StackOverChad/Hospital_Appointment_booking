# Hospital Appointment Booking Website

This project is a Hospital Appointment Booking System designed to streamline the process of scheduling medical consultations. Patients can browse available doctors/services, select suitable appointment slots, and book their appointments online. Upon successful booking, automated confirmation emails are sent to both the patient and the relevant hospital department/personnel, ensuring clear communication and record-keeping. The backend functionalities, including appointment management, user authentication, and email notifications, are powered by [Your Backend Technology, e.g., Supabase, Node.js with Express], while the user interface is built using [Your Frontend Framework, e.g., React, Vue, Svelte with Vite and TypeScript].
